# Temporal-Realignment-of-Audio-Signals
Stand Alone App (Matlab) and Realtime Plugin (VST)
Two software applications capable of addressing challenges arising from comb filtering of audio signals.  An application was developed using the MATLAB Apps platform and a plugin was also developed in C++ as a real-time VST. Both use cross correlation to detect delays between signal paths. Signals can then be realigned using the detected sample delay. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35799468/211156698-ad7f7798-3d56-4251-918f-046b1daf4ce5.png)
