Two software applications capable of addressing challenges arising from comb filtering.  An application was developed using the MATLAB Apps platform and a plugin was also developed in C++ as a real-time VST. 
Both use cross correlation to detect delays between signal paths. 
Signals can then be realigned using the detected sample delay.
